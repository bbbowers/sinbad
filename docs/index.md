**Sinbad** is a software library for [Java](http://java.com), [Python](http://www.python.org), and [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/) that makes it very easy to uniformly access online data sources provided in standard formats (CSV, JSON, XML).

If you are a novice programmer, you probably should go through the [tutorials](#tutorials) below after installing Sinbad. Experienced programmers may benefit more from the [quick start guides](#quick-start). You will also find links to a [quick reference](#quick-reference) and detailed [API documentation](#api-reference) below.

## Installation
Instructions for:
* [Java/Processing/Replit](install-java)
* [Python](install-python)
* [Racket](install-racket)

## Quick Start
These links provide a concise introduction to the most prominent features of the Sinbad library. Use these if you are experienced in the programming language that you are using:

* [Java](quick-start-java)
* [Python](quick-start-python)
* [Racket](quick-start-racket)

## Tutorials
These pages provide a more leisurely and explanatory coverage of the features of the Sinbad library in the respective language. These are good if you are learning to program for the first time and are interested in using Sinbad to access data.

### About the name

*SINBAD* was selected as a rough acronym for **S**tructure **IN**ference and **B**inding **A**utomatically to **D**ata -- the main idea behind the library initially developed in Java. The name was also selected to invoke the sense of adventure, magical experience, and fantastic achievement reminiscent of the voyages of Sinbad the Sailor in the stories of the Arabian Nights. Through this library, we hope to help students experience some of the adventure and magic of Computer Science early on in their programming courses.
